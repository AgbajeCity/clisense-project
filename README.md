# CliSense: AI-Powered Climate Resilience Platform for African Farmers

CliSense is a mobile-first web application designed to empower smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa with critical climate insights and adaptation strategies to address the urgent challenge of climate-driven crop losses.

## Problem Statement

Smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Rwanda, face devastating crop losses due to climate change:
- 50% of crops are lost to climate disruptions (World Bank, 2022)
- Only 7% of Rwanda's cultivated land is irrigated (FAO, 2020)
- Rainfall levels are projected to decline by 23% by 2050 (USAID, 2022)
- Agriculture contributes 67% to Rwanda's GDP (National Institute of Statistics Rwanda, 2021)

These farmers lack access to accurate, localized climate data and adaptation strategies, leaving them vulnerable to climate disruptions.
